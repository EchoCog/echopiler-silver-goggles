I will now proceed to implement a GitHub Action workflow that evaluates project progress based on the feature list and sets next priorities. The workflow will run daily and generate a report.
Step 1: Create GitHub Action Workflow


    Create a new workflow file .github/workflows/progress_evaluation.yml.
    Implement steps to evaluate progress based on the feature list.
    Add a cron schedule to run daily.
    Include a step to generate and commit the report.


Let's start by creating the workflow file.
YAML


name: Project Progress Evaluation


on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs daily at midnight UTC
  workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering


jobs:
  evaluate_progress:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest


    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2








      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```








### Step 2: Create the Python script
Create a new directory `.github/scripts/` and add a Python script `evaluate_progress.py` to evaluate the progress and generate a report.








```python
import yaml
from datetime import datetime








# Load the feature list from the .bolt/prompt file
with open('.bolt/prompt', 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()








# Extract the progress information from the file content
# You can use regular expressions or any other method to parse the progress information








# For simplicity, let's assume we have parsed the necessary information
on the feature list.
