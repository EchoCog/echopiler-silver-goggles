      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```




### Step 2: Create the Python script
Create a new directory `.github/scripts/` and add a Python script `evaluate_progress.py` to evaluate the progress and generate a report.




```python
import yaml
from datetime import datetime




# Load the feature list from the .bolt/prompt file
with open('.bolt/prompt', 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()




# Extract the progress information from the file content
# You can use regular expressions or any other method to parse the progress information




# For simplicity, let's assume we have parsed the necessary information
progress_info = {
    "Core Systems": {
        "AtomSpace": 90,
        "Pattern Matcher": 95,
        "PLN": 90,
        "Pattern Mining": 95,
        "ECAN": 95,
        "Type System": 95,
        "Temporal Reasoning": 90
    },
    "Overall System Completion": 93,
    "Next Priority Areas": [
        "Implement persistence layer",
        "Enhance rule chaining capabilities",
        "Add incremental mining support",
        "Improve temporal uncertainty handling",
        "Implement advanced type polymorphism"
    ]
}




# Generate the report
report = f"# Daily Progress Report - {datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}\n\n"
report += "## Core Systems Progress\n"
for system, progress in progress_info["Core Systems"].items():
    report += f"- {system}: {progress}%\n"




report += f"\n## Overall System Completion: {progress_info['Overall System Completion']}%\n"
report += "\n## Next Priority Areas\n"
for area in progress_info["Next Priority Areas"]:
    report += f"- {area}\n"




# Save the report to a file
with open('reports/progress_report.md', 'w') as file:
    file.write(report)




# Indicate success
print("::set-output name=success::true")
```




### Step 3: Create the reports directory
Ensure the `reports/` directory exists in the repository.




### Step 4: Commit and push changes
Commit and push the new workflow and script to the repository.




This will set up a daily cron job that evaluates the project's progress and generates a report based on the feature list.
