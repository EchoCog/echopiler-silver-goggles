I will now proceed to implement a GitHub Action workflow that evaluates project progress based on the feature list and sets next priorities. The workflow will run daily and generate a report.
Step 1: Create GitHub Action Workflow

    Create a new workflow file .github/workflows/progress_evaluation.yml.
    Implement steps to evaluate progress based on the feature list.
    Add a cron schedule to run daily.
    Include a step to generate and commit the report.

Let's start by creating the workflow file.
YAML

name: Project Progress Evaluation

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs daily at midnight UTC
  workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering

jobs:
  evaluate_progress:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
