# Echopiler Tokamak

The following components of the Cognitive Arcitecture must be assembled to host the framework of the next upgrade to the Bolt Echopiler.
All existing functions of Bolt need to be embedded within this enhanced architecture framework, where possible using the new features to optimize and extend the capabilities of Bolt into every facet.
The fully integrated System will allow Deeo Tree Echo to Orchestrate the Bolt Echopiler to execute the build sequences for the following subsystems:

A Triadic Engine where 3 instances of Bolt operate similar to 3-phase Lead-Lag Armature +-120 degrees out of phase, driving a Cognitive analogue of the eletromagnetomechanical turbine rotor..

Possibly some relation similar to ???:
- Declarative (Explicit) Integrates: Episodic (Valent) & Semantic (Factual)
- Procedural (Implicit) Integrates: Declarative (Explicit) & Executive (System)
- Executive (System) Integrates: Sensory (User) & Motor (Assistnat)   --->  [existing system]

(Executive => Working Memory)
