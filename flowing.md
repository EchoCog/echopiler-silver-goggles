I will now proceed to implement a GitHub Action workflow that evaluates project progress based on the feature list and sets next priorities. The workflow will run daily and generate a report.

### Step 1: Create GitHub Action Workflow
1. Create a new workflow file `.github/workflows/progress_evaluation.yml`.
2. Implement steps to evaluate progress based on the feature list.
3. Add a cron schedule to run daily.
4. Include a step to generate and commit the report.

Let's start by creating the workflow file.

### Step 2: Create the Python script
Create a new directory `.github/scripts/` and add a Python script `evaluate_progress.py` to evaluate the progress and generate a report.

### Step 3: Create the reports directory
Ensure the `reports/` directory exists in the repository.

### Step 4: Commit and push changes
Commit and push the new workflow and script to the repository.

This will set up a daily cron job that evaluates the project's progress and generates a report based on the feature list.
